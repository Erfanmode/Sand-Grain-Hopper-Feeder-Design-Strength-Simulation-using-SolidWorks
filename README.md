# Sand & Grains Hopper Feeder Design & Strength Simulation using SolidWorks - Spring 2022
In this project, we design a sand and grain hopper feeder for the capacity of 30 Tons. Feeder is able to push out the sand and grains
with high moisture. Additionally, it can withstand powerful winds and high magnitude of earthquakes. Huge shout-out to my dear friend and teammate [Reyhane Nikoobayan](https://github.com/ReyhaneNikoobayan) for her contribution to this project.
